Hey, I'm Asrinne! A front-end developer who loves building sleek websites and learning new tech. Fluent in React, debugging, and occasionally breaking things (only to fix them again 😆).

🌱 When I’m not coding, I’m growing stuff—both in my skillset and in my little garden. Also on a mission to perfect anti-inflammatory cooking (chia pudding, anyone?).

🚀 Currently: Learning Strapi and searching for my dream job! 

## Skills 💫

Front-end: React, Vue, Next.js, HTML, CSS, SCSS🎨
