<h1>👋HI!!</h1>

## About Me :smile:
Hey, I'm Asrinne! A frontend developer who loves building sleek websites and learning new tech. Fluent in React, debugging, and occasionally breaking things (only to fix them again 😆).

🌱 When I’m not coding, I’m growing stuff—both in my skillset and in my little garden. Also on a mission to perfect anti-inflammatory cooking (chia pudding, anyone?).

🚀 Currently: Having my internship at Neovici, building cool projects and making peace with Git merges.

## Skills 💫
Programming Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript ✌️

Front-end: React, Vue, HTML, CSS, SCSS🎨

Back-end: Node.js 🖥️
